# Project status

These Ancient Greek and Latin stopwords for textual analysis are primarily designed to be used in [Voyant Tools](http://voyant-tools.org/), where they have been implemented.

The lists are still being refined and documented: see the [project rationale and history](rationale.md) and the [revision notes and TODOs](revision_notes.md).

# Current lists

* [Ancient Latin stopwords](stopwords_latin.txt) (version 2)
* [Ancient Greek stopwords](stopwords_greek.txt) (version 2)

This is still a work in progress. Questions, comments and advice are most welcome.
