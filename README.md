# Project status

Materials originally used to propose default Ancient Greek and Latin stopwords in [Voyant Tools](http://voyant-tools.org/). Both lists have been implemented in Voyant Tools on 2017-10-16. They have been further refined and the process is being better documented: see details and todos in the [elements for discussion](https://github.com/aurelberra/stopwords/blob/master/elements_for_discussion.md) and the written-up [rationale](rationale.md).
