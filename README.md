# Project status

* Materials originally used to propose default Ancient Greek and Latin stopwords in [Voyant Tools](http://voyant-tools.org/). Both lists have been implemented in Voyant Tools on 2017-10-16. They now have to be refined and better documented: this is still an ongoing discussion.
* See the [elements for discussion](https://github.com/aurelberra/stopwords/blob/master/elements_for_discussion.md).

# TODO

* Clean up the lists: remove legacy oddities and harmonise paradigms currently included.
* Decide what categories have to be extended and what paradigms should be completed (for lack of clear statistical motivation based on explicit corpora).
* Integrate [DCC core lists](http://dcc.dickinson.edu/vocab/core-vocabulary) â€“ or explicitly base both lists on them?
* Submit improved versions to Voyant Tools.
* Explain rationale and update lists on [DigiClass wiki](http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Stopwords_for_Greek_and_Latin).
