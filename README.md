# Project status

These Ancient Greek and Latin stopwords are primarily designed for use in [Voyant Tools](http://voyant-tools.org/), where they have been implemented. The lists are still being refined and documented: see the outline in the [elements for discussion](https://github.com/aurelberra/stopwords/blob/master/elements_for_discussion.md) and the more elaborate [rationale](https://github.com/aurelberra/stopwords/blob/master/rationale.md).

# Current lists

* [Ancient Latin stopwords](https://github.com/aurelberra/stopwords/blob/master/stopwords_latin.txt) (version 2)
* [Ancient Greek stopwords](https://github.com/aurelberra/stopwords/blob/master/stopwords_greek.txt) (version 2)

# TODO

* [ ] Submit improved versions to Voyant Tools

* [ ] Explain rationale and update lists on [DigiClass wiki page](http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Stopwords_for_Greek_and_Latin)
