# Project status

Materials originally used to propose default Ancient Greek and Latin stopwords in [Voyant Tools](http://voyant-tools.org/). Both lists have been implemented in Voyant Tools on 2017-10-16. They now have to be refined and better documented. This is still an ongoing discussion: see the [elements for discussion](https://github.com/aurelberra/stopwords/blob/master/elements_for_discussion.md).

# Current lists

* [Ancient Latin stopwords](https://github.com/aurelberra/stopwords/blob/master/stopwords_latin.txt) (version 2)
* [Ancient Greek stopwords](https://github.com/aurelberra/stopwords/blob/master/stopwords_greek.txt) (version 1)

    * [x] Clean up the lists: remove legacy oddities and harmonise paradigms currently included

    * [x] Use [DCC core lists](http://dcc.dickinson.edu/vocab/core-vocabulary)
    * [x] Update from PHI 5 lists of 100, 500, 1000 most frequent words
