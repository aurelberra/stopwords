# Project status

* Materials originally used to propose default Ancient Greek and Latin stopwords in [Voyant Tools](http://voyant-tools.org/).
* 2017-10-16 Both lists have been implemented in Voyant Tools. They now have to be refined and better documented: this is still an ongoing discussion.

# TODO

* Decide what categories have to be extended and what paradigms should be completed (for lack of clear statistical motivation based on explicit corpora)
* Integrate [DCC core lists](http://dcc.dickinson.edu/vocab/core-vocabulary) â€“ or explicitly base both lists on them?
* Explain rationale and update lists on [DigiClass wiki](http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Stopwords_for_Greek_and_Latin)
