# Project status

This repository contains Ancient Greek and Latin [stopwords](https://github.com/aurelberra/stopwords/blob/master/rationale.md#about-stopwords) for textual analysis.

The lists were first designed to be used in the [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/) environment, where they are implemented. They are also integrated into the [*Quanteda Stopwords*](https://github.com/quanteda/stopwords/) R package.

The creation of these data sets is documented in the [project rationale and history](rationale.md) and the [revision notes](revision_notes.md).

# Current lists

* Ancient Latin stopwords: [TXT](stopwords_latin.txt) | [JSON](stopwords_latin.json)
* Ancient Greek stopwords: [TXT](stopwords_greek.txt) | [JSON](stopwords_greek.json)

Questions, comments and advice are most welcome.
