# Project status

Materials originally used to propose default Ancient Greek and Latin stopwords in [Voyant Tools](http://voyant-tools.org/). Both lists have been implemented in Voyant Tools on 2017-10-16. They now have to be refined and better documented. This is still an ongoing discussion: see the [elements for discussion](https://github.com/aurelberra/stopwords/blob/master/elements_for_discussion.md).

# TODO

* [ ] Clean up the lists: remove legacy oddities and harmonise paradigms currently included
* [ ] Decide what categories have to be extended and what paradigms should be completed
* [ ] Integrate [DCC core lists](http://dcc.dickinson.edu/vocab/core-vocabulary)
* [ ] Update from TLG E and PHI 5 lists of 1000 most frequent words
* [ ] Submit improved versions to Voyant Tools
* [ ] Explain rationale and update lists on [DigiClass wiki](http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Stopwords_for_Greek_and_Latin)
